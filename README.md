# Electric Vehicles Analysis Dashboard

## Introduction

The **Electric Vehicles Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive Microsoft Excel-based tool designed to analyze trends in electric vehicle (EV) adoption. It provides insights into:

- Total number of electric vehicles.
- Distribution of EVs across different states.
- Vehicle model-wise distribution.
- Growth trends over the years.
- Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility.

Leveraging Excel's **PivotTables**, **PivotCharts**, **slicers**, and **conditional formatting**, this dashboard allows real-time data filtering and interactive exploration.

## Objective

The primary goals of this dashboard are to:

- **Provide a comprehensive view** of electric vehicle adoption trends.
- **Enable interactive filtering** to analyze data by city, electric utility, and vehicle type.
- **Offer insightful visualizations** for understanding EV distribution, model popularity, and CAFV eligibility.
- **Facilitate data-driven decision-making** for businesses, policymakers, and researchers.
  
## Data Source

The dataset contains information about electric vehicle models, manufacturers, states, CAFV eligibility, and battery range. The data is structured and processed using Excel formulas, PivotTables, and dynamic filtering for smooth interactivity.

## 📊 Manual City-wise EV Summary (Using Excel Formulas) & Conditional Formatting

The following formulas were used to manually generate a city-wise Electric Vehicle (EV) summary in Excel:

| Metric | Formula | 
|:---|:---|
| Unique City List | `=UNIQUE(EV_Data!A2:A177826)` |
| Total EVs by City | `=COUNTIF(EV_Data!A:A, B5)` |
| Electric Utility by City | `=VLOOKUP(B5, EV_Data!A:M, 13, FALSE)` |
| Average Electric Range | `=AVERAGEIFS(EV_Data!J:J, EV_Data!A:A, B5)` |
| Max Base MSRP | `=MAXIFS(EV_Data!J:J, EV_Data!A:A, B5)` |
| City-wise % Share of EVs | `=COUNTIF(EV_Data!A:A, B5) / COUNTA(EV_Data!A:A) * 100` |

This manual approach was performed alongside VBA automation to cross-verify the data accuracy and enhance reporting.

## Conditional Formatting Applied:
- **Headers** styled with bright green background and bold text.
- **Total EVs** column color-coded from yellow (low) to green (high) using gradient scale.
- **City-wise % Share of Total EVs** visualized with blue data bars for easier comparison.
- **Consistent black borders** for clean table presentation.

This manual method ensured cross-verification with automated VBA processes, enhancing both accuracy and report presentation quality.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard consists of multiple interactive sections, each focusing on different insights:

### 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Section

Located on the left side of the dashboard, this section displays summary metrics:
- **Total Vehicles**: Total count of electric vehicles.
- **Average Electric Range**: Mean range (in miles) for all EVs.
- **BEV & PHEV Distribution**: Pie charts displaying the proportion of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) vs. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV).

### 2. Interactive Filter Panel

Positioned at the top, this panel allows users to filter data dynamically by:
- **Electric Utility Provider**: Filter by electricity provider (e.g., Avista Corp).
- **City**: Select a city (e.g., Aberdeen).
- **Electric Vehicle Type**: Filter by BEV or PHEV.

### 3. Total Vehicles by Model Year (Line Chart)

This chart shows the growth trend of EVs from 2010 onwards, illustrating:
- EV adoption over the years.
- Peaks and dips in adoption, highlighting significant years.

### 6. Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility (Donut Chart)

Categorizes vehicles based on their eligibility for the Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) program:
- **Eligible for CAFV Program**: 37%
- **Eligibility Unknown**: 11%
- **Not Eligible (Low battery range)**: 52%
